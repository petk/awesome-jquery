A curated list of awesome [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugins, resources and other shiny things. Inspired by the `awesome-*` trend on GitHub.

> [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a fast, small, and feature-rich [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
